####Why?

Well, saving images from Instagram is a pain, you either need to screenshot it on Mobile or search through the source code on the web. _Aren't there apps for that?_ Well, Yes... But I didn't like most of them, and needed to learn some more jQuery. My code is still a mess, but I will clean it up. I Promise.

I'm not good at writing README's so I'll keep it short.

Here is the [DEMO](https://lars.ninja/insta/) so let me know if I've screwed it somewhere.  :+1:

Any suggestions? Let me know. :wink:

### Stuff used to make this:

 * [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for animations and AJAX
 * [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/) to make the UI
 * [Instagram API](https://instagram.com/developer/) to get Access to Instagram
