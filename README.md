I'm not good at writing README's so I'll keep it short.

Here is the [DEMO](https://github.com/jbt/markdown-editor) so let me know if I've screwed it somewhere.  :+1:



### Stuff used to make this:

 * [jQuery](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) for animations and AJAX
 * [MaterializeCSS](http://codemirror.net/) to make the UI
 * [Instagram API](https://instagram.com/developer/) to get Access to Instagram
